        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p id="info-section">
            I am a recording and mixing engineer, sound designer, and composer based in Manchester, U.K.<br>
            I have gained a diploma from SEM (formerly Manchester Midi School), where I could deepen my knowledge <br>
            in Electronic Music Composition, Advanced Music Production, and Audio Engineering. I have worked as a <br>
            professional singer and actor for over fifteen years and have been doing audio engineering and production <br>
            since 2016. It was at this time that I decided to invest my time and resources into making a career in the music <br>
            industry. In 2021, I graduated in Audio Engineering and Sound Production at Futureworks, University Education for <br>
            The Creative Industries, as a First-Class Student. Lately, I have been working as a Post-production freelance,<br>
            handling the sound design of several professional feature films, short films, and commercials.<br><br>
            
            Alongside my work in the audio industry, I am also passionate about technology and have recently started to explore <br>
            the world of software development. I am eager to broaden my skill set and am currently learning how to become a <br>
            Full Stack Engineer. My goal is to combine my expertise in audio engineering with full stack development, enabling <br>
            me to create innovative solutions that bridge the gap between sound design and web technologies. I am excited about <br>
            the opportunities that lie ahead as I continue to develop my skills in both fields.
